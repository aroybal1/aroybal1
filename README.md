## Hello, my name is Kai Roybal.
I’m a Stanford computer science student on the computer engineering track with interests in quantum computing, biotech, and social impact. I have experience leading cross-functional teams to build AI-powered mobile and web applications, and I enjoy translating real user needs into technically sound, scalable products—particularly in education, health, and community-focused domains.
