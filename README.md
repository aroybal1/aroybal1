## Hello, my name is Kai Roybal

I’m a Stanford computer science student on the computer engineering track with interests in quantum computing, biotech, and software development. I have experience leading cross functional teams to build AI powered mobile and web applications, and I enjoy translating user needs into products in education, health, and community focused domains.

Below are some of the projects I’ve worked on.

## Ventricular Vibes

As a team, **Ventricular Vibes** designed a biotech prototype aimed at reducing right heart failure (RHF), a critical post-implant complication affecting LVAD patients. The project explores pressure sensor driven algorithms for LVAD systems, targeting a projected **>25% reduction in RHF risk** and **>10% reduction in 30-day rehospitalization**.

- Edison Dao  
- Judy Fan  
- Kai Roybal  
- Nathan Foo  
- Rika Terashima

### Summary

**Problem**  
Right heart failure complicates approximately **20–50% of LVAD implants** and is a major contributor to postoperative morbidity and mortality.

**Need Statement**  
There is a need for improved post implant monitoring to reduce RHF incidence and mortality risk in LVAD patients.

**Solution**  
We propose algorithms that integrate continuous **pulmonary artery** and **left ventricular pressure** data from implantable sensors to proactively identify and alert clinicians of elevated RHF risk.

---

### Value Proposition

**Patients**  
- Real time hemodynamic monitoring enables earlier RHF detection  
- Improved quality of life and survival through timely intervention

**Hospitals**  
- Reduced readmissions and shorter hospital stays  
- Lower strain on clinical resources

**Clinicians**  
- Proactive disease management  
- Data to support clinical research and decision making
